# Firefox pushlog

This WebExtension shows adds a submenu in Tools that can be used to shows Firefox changes introduced by last update, or that will be included in a future update.

This feature used to be part of Nightly Tester Tools, but was removed when the add-on was converted into a WebExtension.
